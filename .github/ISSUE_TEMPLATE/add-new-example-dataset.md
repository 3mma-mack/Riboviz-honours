When adding a new example dataset providing links and listing adapters will make the process easier for others to follow. Key steps are listed below.

- [ ] Identify paper or data source - list and link
- [ ] Identify the ribosome profiling samples from the dataset (some may be RNA-seq) - link database
- [ ] Identify adapter sequence - provide sequence
- [ ] Confirm or deny presence of UMIs and barcodes if used - describe if present
- [ ] Using information gathered, create config file
- [ ] Download sample data 
- [ ] Set up riboviz (following [documentation](https://github.com/riboviz/riboviz/blob/main/docs/user/run-on-eddie.md))
- [ ] Test run
- [ ] Look at results/troubleshoot
